# Cameras
## Attaching/Detaching cameras <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

You can detach the player camera to move and rotate it.

```krunkscript
GAME.CAMERA.detach();
GAME.CAMERA.attach();
```

## Moving/Rotating cameras <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

:::warning
Only once the camera is detached, you can also rotate or position it
:::

```krunkscript
# Move camera
GAME.CAMERA.move(
    0,   # num x position
    0,   # num y position
    0    # num z position
);

# Rotate camera
GAME.CAMERA.rotate(
    0,   # num x rotation
    0,   # num y rotation
    0    # num z rotation
);

# Make camera look at coordinates
GAME.CAMERA.lookAt(
    0,   # num x position
    0,   # num y position
    0    # num z position
);
```

## Camera methods <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

```krunkscript
# Field of view
GAME.CAMERA.fov(90); # num (10-170)

# Shake the camera
GAME.CAMERA.shake(0.9); # num (0 - 1)
```


# Custom assets

## 3D models <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: asset, custom**

:::tip
Currently only .obj and .gltf are supported for 3d models
:::

You can import and manage 3d models inside of krunker using KrunkScript.

```krunkscript
# Add an asset to the scene.
GAME.SCENE.addAsset(
    "236t",         # str 3d asset id
    5,              # num x position
    0,              # num y position
    5,              # num z position
    1,              # num scale
    "#FFF",         # str color
    {},             # obj additional data
    onObjectLoad    # action callback when asset loads. (function name is function used for callback)
);
```

## Textures & images <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

:::tip
Currently only .png images are supported
:::

```krunkscript
# Create an object reference and change its texture id.
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube("", "#fff", 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10);
cube.texture = "28000";
```

## Animations <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

### Default animations <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: clips**

The krunker playermodels has some player animations by default.

- **Idle:** Loops while player is idle
- **Move:** Loops while player is moving
- **Crouch:** Loops while player is crouched
- **Jump:** Plays when player jumps
- **Melee:** Plays when player melees
- **Shoot:** Plays when player shoots

### Custom animations <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
:::tip
Only gltf's support animations
:::

```krunkscript
# Create a 3d asset object
obj object = GAME.SCENE.addAsset("11441g", 0, 0, 0, 1);

# Play animation on object
object.playAnim(
	"Jump",             # str clip name
	1                   # num repetitions (0 = infinite loop)
);

# You can also do this on players and AI
player.playAnim("Jump");
aiBot.playAnim("Jump");

# Stop object animation
object.stopAnim();
```

```krunkscript
# Playing an animation thru GAME method
obj object = GAME.SCENE.addAsset("11441g", 0, 0, 0, 1);

# Play animation
GAME.ANIM.playClip(object, "Jump", 0);

# Stop animation
GAME.ANIM.stopClip(object, "Jump");
```

## Sounds & music <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: audio**

:::tip
The `sound asset id` parameter will automatically convert str's to num's as of update 5.5.0
:::

```krunkscript
# Play sound in 2D space
obj sound = GAME.SOUND.play2D(
    0,      # num sound asset id
    1,      # num volume (0 - 1)
    1,      # num rate (0 - 1)
    true    # bool looping
);
```

```krunkscript
# Play sound in 3D space
obj sound = GAME.SOUND.play3D(
    37204,  # num sound asset id
    1,      # num volume (0 - 1) 
    5,      # num x position
    0,      # num y position
    5,      # num z position
    0.9,    # num rate (0 - 1)
    true    # bool looping
);
```

```krunkscript
# Alter rate & volume
sound.rate = 0.5;
sound.volume = 0.2;

# Mute, unmute, play, stop & pause
sound.mute();
sound.unmute();
sound.play();
sound.stop();
sound.pause();

# Fade
sound.fade(
    0.9,    # num volume start (0 - 1)
    0.1,    # num volume end (0 - 1)
    0       # num duration
);
```

# Data storage

## Database <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: database**

Databases allow you to store variables permanently, without being able to be modified by others. Its useful for keeping track of currencies, personal best scores and what items a player owns. 


:::tip
To delete data storage values you can use `delete all` as a key
:::

:::warning
- Make sure to use player.accountName (server-side only) instead of player.username
- You can only store and access data from players who are active in game
- set, update, transact every 10 seconds per connection/player
- load every 5 seconds per connection/player
- 30 Keys per map, keys length is 20 characters. (Object properties are treated as unique database keys)
:::

### Set storage <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
```krunkscript
# Set a player value to a specific value
GAME.STORAGE.set(
    "SwatDoge",                     # str accountName
    {kills: 300, nick: "Swat"},     # obj data
    true,                           # bool private (false: private, true: public) Public databases can be accessed by others
    callback                        # action(obj data, bool success, str accountName) callback function
);
```

### Update storage <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
```krunkscript
# Updating ADDS the value you give it to the existing value. Negative values will thus be subtracted.
# Removing 5 kills from SwatDoge's kills
GAME.STORAGE.update(
    "SwatDoge",    # str accountName
    {kills: -5},   # obj data
    true,          # bool private (false: private, true: public) Public databases can be accessed by others
    callback       # action(obj data, bool success, str accountName) callback function
);
```

### Transact storage <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
```krunkscript
# The same as GAME.STORAGE.update but you can not go below 0. If this does happen, the success parameter on the callback function will be false
GAME.STORAGE.transact(
    "SwatDoge",   # str accountName
    {kills: -5},  # obj data
    true,         # bool private (false: private, true: public) Public databases can be accessed by others
    callback      # action(obj data, bool success, str accountName) callback function
);
```

### Loading Data <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />

:::warning
Loading from an empty database will result in an error message "No data" and not call the callback
:::

```krunkscript
# Load data you stored on your map
GAME.STORAGE.load(
    "SwatDoge",     # str accountName
    "",             # str name of game with public database. (leave empty)
    callback        # action(obj data, bool success, str accountName) callback function
);
```

```krunkscript
# Load data you stored on another map
GAME.STORAGE.load(
    "SwatDoge",     # str accountName
    "lava_run",     # str name of game with public database. (leave empty)
    callback        # action(obj data, bool success, str accountName) callback function
);
```

## Cookies <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: localstorage**

Cookies allow you to store variables on a users browser. These variables can be modified by users and should not be relied on for source of truth.
Useful for settings.

:::warning
Cookies can only store strings as values
:::

```krunkscript
# Save cookie
GAME.COOKIES.save(
    "test",   # str name
    "100"     # str data
);
```

```krunkscript
# Load cookie
str value = GAME.COOKIES.load(
    "test"   # str name
);
```

```krunkscript
# Delete cookie
GAME.COOKIES.remove(
    "test"   # str name
);
```

```krunkscript
# Check if cookie exists
GAME.COOKIES.has(
    "test"    # str name
);
```


# Game logic

## Order of execution <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
1. **Game Loop:** Timed loop to update the world.
2. **Game Elements:** Objects and Components in your game.
3. **Inputs/Controls:** User-actions & inputs.
4. **Feedback:** Response to user-actions & inputs applied to elements.
5. **Rendering:** Visual representation of game elements.

## Timing <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

:::warning
- You can only freeze time on the server side
- GAME.TIME.fixedDelta() does not work
- GAME.TIME.now() is based on system time. Its recommended to sync with server time
:::

```krunkscript
# Get current time in unix
num time = GAME.TIME.now();

# Delta gives you the miliseconds between updates
public action update(delta) {

    # Moving a cube at a consistent speed, regardless of framerate
	(num) object.x += ((num) object.speed * delta);
}

# Freeze or unfreeze game timer
GAME.TIME.freeze();
GAME.TIME.unfreeze();

# Get delta unaffected by game speed
GAME.TIME.fixedDelta();
```

## Players <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

:::tip
GAME.PLAYERS.findByID() and GAME.PLAYERS.list() do not return references but instances
:::

```krunkscript
# Get own player object (client-side)
obj self = GAME.PLAYERS.getSelf();

# Get a player by their id
obj player = GAME.PLAYERS.findByID(
    id # str player id
);

# Access player list
obj[] players = GAME.PLAYERS.list();

# If player does not exist.
if (notEmpty player && !player) {
    GAME.log("Player does not exist.");
}
```

You can change/access player values like with any other objects:

:::tip
You can get the [full player object here](/lists/player_object.html)
:::
:::warning
- player.assetID requires `player type` in `class config > player asset` to be set to `model`
:::

```krunkscript
player.position.x = 10;        # num set x pos
player.rotation.x = 0.3;       # num set x direction
player.velocity.x = 0.1;       # num set x velocity

player.isYou;                  # bool player reference is self (client-side)
player.assetID = "325253";     # update player model
```

### Modifying loadout slots
:::tip
You can use the [krunker weapon id's list](./lists/weapon_ids.html) to find the right ID for your weapon
:::
:::warning
- You can only change on server side
- Clearing the melee slot seems to not work at the moment
- You can only give/change weapons to their designated slot (pistol = secondary only, ak = primary only)
:::

```krunkscript
# void clear loadout of player
player.clearLoadout();

# void change primary item from player
player.changePrimary(           
    0 # weapon id
);

# void change secondary item from player
player.changeSecondary(         
    0 # weapon id
);  

# void give player weapon
player.giveWeapon(              
    0 # weapon id
);           
```

```krunkscript
# void remove melee item from player
player.removeMelee();

# void remove primary item from player
player.removePrimary();

# void remove secondary item from player
player.removeSecondary();

### Adding fonts and images to CSS <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle"/>
You can not use links in KrunkScript for security reasons, but you can use a prefix to load in images and fonts.

:::tip
- Images go into the `css-img` folder
- Fonts go into the `css/fonts/` folder
:::

:::warning
- **Protected elements** are non-modifyable elements, and will break your mod if modified with css. These elements could be KR count, ads, canvas elements and like/dislike buttons, etc
- Images only support png, every fonttype is supported
- You can not import any other resource then png's and fonts
:::

```css
.iconProfile {
    background-image: CSSIMAGE:profile; /* css-img/profile.png */
}

@font-face {
    font-family: "CustomFont";
    src: CSSFONT:font2; /* css/fonts/font2.ttf */
}

* {
    font-family: "CustomFont";  /*Make all text the custom font*/
}
```

## Settings override <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle"/>
In `/scripts/settings.txt` you can load player settings like shown below.
```
# settingname, value
shaderRendering, false
resolution, 0.6
shadows, true
softShad, false
highResShad, false
postProcessing, true
bloom, false
```

To view a full list of changeable settings, click [here](https://krunker.io/docs/settings.txt). These settings are reset once a player leaves your game.

## Settings thru KrunkScript <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle"/>

```krunkscript
# Update setting
GAME.SETTINGS.set(
    "resolution",   # str setting name
    "2"             # str value
);
```

```krunkscript
# Get setting value of player
GAME.SETTINGS.get(
    "resolution",   # str setting name
);
```

```krunkscript
# Get str[] of all available settings
GAME.SETTINGS.list();
```

# Multiplayer & networking

Networking allows you to send variables to the server, which can then send it back to other players, or store it in a database.

::: warning
**Networking must be optimized at all costs**

- Data: 2000 bytes per message
- Broadcast (server to all): 10 msg per second
- Send (server to client): 20 msg per second per user
- Send (client to server): 40 msg per second
- Message id string: 10 Characters
:::

## Sending data <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

First off you have to send your variable to either the server or the client, they will be able to listen for the variable so they can use it.

Sending is used for sending data to one specific user.


:::: tabs 
::: tab Client
```krunkscript
# Sending data on the client
GAME.NETWORK.send(
    "test",     # str message name
    {a: 1}      # obj data
);
```
:::
::: tab Server
```krunkscript
# Sending data on the server
GAME.NETWORK.send(
    "test",     # str message name
    {a: 1},     # obj data
    player.id   # player id
);
```
:::
::::

## Broadcasting data <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />

Broadcasting allows you to send data to all connected clients.

```krunkscript
# Send data to all clients
GAME.NETWORK.broadcast(
    "test",     # str message name
    {a: 1}      # obj data
);
```

## Receiving data <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

Once the message has been sent, we can listen for it and use its given object.

:::: tabs
::: tab Client
```krunkscript
# Receive message from client
public action onNetworkMessage(str id, obj data) {
    #str id             - message name
    #obj data           - data as string
}
```
:::
::: tab Server
```krunkscript
# Receive message from server

## Detect rate limiting <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

KrunkScript rate limits you to prevent spam over the network.

```krunkscript
# Will return a "success" boolean, if false you are being rate limited
if (GAME.NETWORK.broadcast("hi there", {a: 1}) {
    # message was sent
} 
else {
    # message rate limited
}
```

## Sending & broadcasting chat messages <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
You can send chat messages from the server.

:::warning
- Send: 2 msg per second
- Broadcast: 2 msg per second
:::

```krunkscript
# Send message to specific player
GAME.CHAT.send(
    player.id,      # str player id
    "hello world",  # str message
    "#FFF"          # str color
);
```

```krunkscript
# Broadcast message to all players
GAME.CHAT.broadcast(
    "hello world",  # str message
    "#FFF"          # str color
);
```

## Movement syncing <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
Every second the server sends the players position to the client. Once that information arrives at the client, the client retraces its steps since that point in time to now, using the corrected information that it has received from the server.

If your movement code includes custom playervalues, those have to be registered, to be included in the sync.

:::tip
Check out [this example](/examples/double_jump.html) to add basic double jumping using server syncing
:::

:::warning
- To sync a player property, the property must exist first (currently it gives a wrong error)
- Syncing objects is not yet possible
- Sync values can be up to 16 characters long
- You can have up to 20 sync variables at once per player
:::

```krunkscript
# Create player reference
obj players = GAME.players.getSelf();

# Set property
players.hasDoubleJump = true;

# Start syncing player value
player.registerSyncValues(
    "hasDoubleJump"     #str object key
);
```

```krunkscript
# Stop syncing player value
player.unregisterSyncValues(
    "hasDoubleJump"     #str object key
);
```

## Open a window to a different game or platform  <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

```krunkscript
GAME.URLS.openDiscord(
    "YBnq2um"                            # str discord invite url
);
```

```krunkscript
GAME.URLS.openOpensea(
    "https://opensea.io/SwatDoge"        # str openSea wallet url
);
```

```krunkscript
GAME.URLS.openTwitter(
    "https://twitter.com/swatdoge"       # str twitter url
);
```

```krunkscript
GAME.URLS.openYoutube(
    "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQM8ePPA8me73585aLJvmw"       # str youtube url
);
```

```krunkscript
GAME.changeGame(
    "DQ_Battleboats"                    # str game name
);
```

## Getting host <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />

:::warning
You can only retrieve host player object if player is spawned in
:::
```krunkscript
# Get player object of host
obj player = GAME.CONFIG.getHost();
```

# Platforms

## Detect platform <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 

:::tip
You can make your UI mobile compatable: [Custom CSS phone compatability](/unmerged/user_interface.html#custom-css-phone-compatability)
:::

```krunkscript
GAME.PLATFORM.isMobile();       # bool client is on mobile
GAME.PLATFORM.isBrowser();      # bool client is on browsers
GAME.PLATFORM.isClient();       # bool client is on a client
```

# 2D Rendering

## Overlay canvas <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Krunker has a 2d overlay called *the canvas*. It allows you to render shapes and text on top of a 2d overlay.

```krunkscript
# Get dimensions of overlay obj{x, y} 
GAME.OVERLAY.getSize();
```
```krunkscript
# Move entire overlay 
GAME.OVERLAY.offset(
    10,     # num x offset
    0       # num y offset
);             
```
```krunkscript
# Scale overlay
GAME.OVERLAY.scale(
    0.1     #num scale
);                
```

```krunkscript
# Get text width (num) on overlay based on font size
GAME.OVERLAY.measureText(
    10,     #num font size
    "Test", #str text
    "serif" #str font family name
);
```

```krunkscript
# Clear overlay
GAME.OVERLAY.clear();
```

## Render loop <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
You can draw on the overlay using the [render](/unmerged/scripting.html#render) hook.

:::tip
The render hook runs after the update hook, see [order of execution](/unmerged/game_logic.html#order-of-execution)
:::

```krunkscript
action render(num delta) {
    # Create a red triangle
    GAME.OVERLAY.drawRect(0, 0, 20, 15, 0, "#ff0000", 1);
}
```

## 2D shapes <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 

:::tip
Canvas shapes start at the top left of your screen, setting position will offset it to the bottom right
:::

### Text

:::tip
You can use a custom font-family from a mod for the canvas, as shown in the example below
:::

:::warning
Keep in mind that default browser font families may differ for other browsers
:::

```krunkscript

# Draw text on screen
GAME.OVERLAY.drawText(
    "Hello world",  # str text
    0,              # num x position
    0,              # num y position
    0,              # num rotation (0 - 360)
    20,             # num font size
    "center",       # str alignment ("left", "center", "right")
    "#FFF",         # str color
    0.9,            # num opacity
    "comic sans"    # str font
);

# Get canvas text width
num textWidth = GAME.OVERLAY.measureText(
    24,         # num fontsize
    "Testing",  # str text
    "serif"     # str font family name
);
```

### Rectangles

```krunkscript
GAME.OVERLAY.drawRect(
    0,            # num x position
    0,            # num y position
    100,          # num width
    100,          # num height
    0,            # num rotation (0 - 360)
    "#FFF",       # str color
    0.9,          # num opacity (0 - 1)
    false         # bool center
);
```

### Circles

```krunkscript
GAME.OVERLAY.drawCircle(
    0,           # num x position
    0,           # num y position
    100,         # num width
    100,         # num height
    0,           # num rotation (0 - 360)
    "#FFF",      # str color
    0.9,         # num opacity (0 - 1)
    false        # bool center
);
```

### Line

```krunkscript
GAME.OVERLAY.drawLine(
    0,           # num x start position
    0,           # num y start position
    100,         # num x end position
    100,         # num y end position
    20,          # num thickness
    "#FFF",      # str color
    0.9          # num opacity (0 - 1)
);
```

### Images

```krunkscript
GAME.OVERLAY.drawImage(
    "28142",    # str texture asset id
    0,          # num x position
    0,          # num y position
    256,        # num width
    256,        # num height
    0,          # num rotation (0 - 360)
    0.9         # num opacity (1 - 0)
);
```

### Arc
:::tip
An arc is essentially a circle, but with more controll on where it starts and ends
:::

```krunkscript
# Draw half a circle
OVERLAY.arc(
    5,                  # num position x
    10,                 # num position y
    17,                 # num circle radius
    0,                  # num angle the circle starts
    Math.PI,            # num angle the circle ends
    true                # bool is counter clockwise
);
```

#### Arc clipping
Using arcTo, you can set boundaries to how far a circle flows until it collides between lines. For a better description check out [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arcTo) documentation.
```krunkscript
GAME.OVERLAY.arcTo(
    180,    # num x start position
    130,    # num y start position
    110,    # num x end position
    130,    # num y end position
    130     # num radius
);
```

### Ellipse
```krunkscript
GAME.OVERLAY.ellipse(
    20,     # num x position
    20,     # num y position
    20,     # num x radius
    20,     # num y radius
    90,     # num rotation angle
    20,     # num starting angle
    80,     # num ending angle
    false   # bool is counter clockwise
);
```

### Curves
Curves draw from cursor to a point, but are influenced by a control point

![Preview](/images/krunker/renderingcontext2d/curve_control_point.png)

#### Quadratic curve

```krunkscript
# Draw quadratic curve from cursor
OVERLAY.quadraticCurveTo(
    230         # num control point x position
    230         # num control point y position
    400         # num start point y position
    20          # num end point y position
);
```

#### Bezier curve

```krunkscript
# Draw bezier curve from cursor
OVERLAY.bezierCurveTo(
    230         # num control point 1 x position
    230         # num control point 1 y position
    300         # num control point 2 x position
    400         # num control point 2 y position
    400         # num start point y position
    20          # num end point y position
);
```

## Direct canvas drawing <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
In javascript, you can draw on the canvas using the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` API. Krunkscript also allows you to do this, and works mostly the same.

To create one of these drawings, you first make a path by moving the cursor and pathing shapes. After that you "stroke" (draw) the path. These lines and shapes can be modified in several ways to fit your needs.

:::warning
- These features are not officially documented, there might be mistakes
- This part of the doc is not final
:::

:::tip
It's recommended to check out the [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) documentation, as GAME.OVERLAY is a direct api for it.
:::

### Creating a basic line
```krunkscript
# Starting the path
GAME.OVERLAY.beginPath();

# Move cursor to a position
GAME.OVERLAY.moveTo(50, 140);

# Draw line
GAME.OVERLAY.lineTo(150, 60);

# Closing the path
GAME.OVERLAY.closePath();

# Drawing out the path
GAME.OVERLAY.stroke();
```

### Moving & drawing
```krunkscript
# Move the cursor
GAME.OVERLAY.moveTo(
    50,     # num x position
    140     # num y position
);
```

```krunkscript
# Set line width
GAME.OVERLAY.lineWidth(
    20       # num pixel width
);

# Set line dash width
GAME.OVERLAY.lineDashOffset(
    5        # num space between dashes on line
);

# Set corners where two lines meet
GAME.OVERLAY.lineJoin(
    "round"     #str type ("round", "bevel", "miter")
);

# Draw a line from cursor
GAME.OVERLAY.lineTo(
    150,     # num x position
    60       # num y position
);
```

### Filling & filling style
You can fill a shape with a certain color.

```krunkscript
# Set filling style
GAME.OVERLAY.fillStyle(
    "#FFF"  # str color
);

# Fill a path (before stroke)
GAME.OVERLAY.fill();
```

### Stroke & stroke style
Stroke style is the color of stroke lines.

```krunkscript
# Set stroke style
GAME.OVERLAY.strokeStyle(
    "#FFF"  # str color
);
```

```krunkscript
# Start stroking a path
GAME.OVERLAY.stroke();

# Stroke text
OVERLAY.strokeText(
    "SwatDoge",     # str text to stroke out
    20,             # num x position
    10,             # num y position
    5               # num max width of stroke
);

# Stroke rectangle
OVERLAY.strokeRect(
    20,             # num x position 
    10,             # num y position
    15,             # num width
    17              # num height
);
```

### Transforming & translating paths
You can modify a paths properties using translation.

```krunkscript
# Move path relative to itself
GAME.OVERLAY.translate(
    20,     # num x direction
    20      # num y direction
);
```

```krunkscript
# Transform allows you to translate an object thru a matrix
GAME.OVERLAY.transform(
    1,      # horizontal scaling
    0,      # horizontal skewing
    1,      # vertical skewing
    1,      # vertical scaling
    0,      # horizontal moving
    0       # vertical moving
);
```

```krunkscript
# Resets the current transform and reapplies using transform()
GAME.OVERLAY.setTransform(
    1,      # horizontal scaling
    0,      # horizontal skewing
    1,      # vertical skewing
    1,      # vertical scaling
    0,      # horizontal moving
    0       # vertical moving
);
```

### Saving & restoring drawing styles
```krunkscript
# Save a drawing state
GAME.OVERLAY.save();
```

```krunkscript
# Rollback a drawing state
GAME.OVERLAY.restore();
```

### Global draw opacity 
**Tags: alpha, transparency**

```krunkscript
# Set opacity of rendering context
GAME.OVERLAY.globalAlpha(
    1       # num (0-1) opacity
);
```



# Scene

## Skydome <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: skybox**

Skydomes are a group of settings that allow you to change the atmosphere of your level in certain areas.

```krunkscript
# Set sky color (single color)
GAME.SCENE.setSkyColor(
    "#fff"      # str color
);
```

```krunkscript
# Set skydome settings (gradient colors)
GAME.SCENE.setSkyDome(
    "#fff",     # str hex color 1
    "#fff",     # str hex color 2
    "#fff",     # str hex color 3
    {}          # obj additional data
);
```

```krunkscript
# Additional data to change the skydome
obj additional = {
    texture: "27997",            # str asset id
    emissive: "#ff0000",         # str hex color
    emissiveTexture: "27998",    # str asset id 
    textureMoveAxis: 0,          # str/num axis (0 - 1 OR "x" - "y")
    textureMoveSpeed: 0          # num speed (-20 - 20)
};
```

```krunkscript
# Change fog settings
GAME.SCENE.setFog(
    "#fff",     # str color
    100         # num distance
);
```

```krunkscript
# Get active zone
num activeZone = (num) GAME.CAMERA.envZone; # index or -1 if default
```

```krunkscript
# Remove skydome
GAME.SCENE.removeSkyDome();
```

## Scene lighting <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 

Lighting allows you to light up your scenes, adding atmosphere and detail to your map.

:::tip
For better performance it is recommended to use ["fake" lighting](https://docs.krunker.io/#/./files/scene?id=lights)
:::

```krunkscript
# Adjust the ingame sun
GAME.SCENE.setSkyLight(
    "#fff",     # str color
    2,          # num light intensity (0 - 3)
    20,         # num sun angle x (0 - 360)
    20,         # num sun angle y (0 - 360)
    100         # num light distance (10 - 15000)
);
```

```krunkscript
# Adjust the ingame ambient light
GAME.SCENE.setAmbientLight(
    "#fff",     # str color
    2           # num light intensity (0 - 3)
);
```

### Point light: (bulb, candle, flame etc.)

A pointlight is a light source that shines in every direction.

![Preview](/images/krunker/scene/lights_0.png)

```krunkscript
# Add a pointlight
obj lamp = GAME.SCENE.addPointLight(
    "#fff", # str color
    0,      # num x position
    0,      # num y position
    0,      # num z position
    50,     # num decay
    0.1,    # num intensity (0 - 1)
    false   # bool cast shadows
);
```

### Directional light (sun)

Directional light is an infinitely far away light, which lights up the entire map.

![Preview](/images/krunker/scene/lights_1.png)

```krunkscript
# Add a directional light
obj sun = GAME.SCENE.addDirLight(
    "#fff", # str color
    0,      # num x direction
    0,      # num y direction
    0,      # num z direction
    10,     # num x target position
    10,     # num y target position
    10,     # num z target position
    false   # bool cast shadows
);
```

### Spot Light (Flashlight, Projector etc.)

A spot light is a direct source of light, which shines on a precise point.

![Preview](/images/krunker/scene/lights_2.png)

```krunkscript
# Add a spotlight
obj flashlight = GAME.SCENE.addSpotLight(
    "#fff", # str color
    0,      # num x position
    20,     # num y position
    0,      # num z position
    10,     # num x target position
    10,     # num y target position
    10,     # num z target position
    50,     # num range
    0.1,    # num decay (0 - 1)
    0.9,    # num intensity (0 - 1)
    0,      # num angle (0 - 360)
    0,      # num penumbra
    false   # bool cast shadows
);
```

### Rectangular area light (windows, screens etc.)

Simular to a spotlight, but square.

![Preview](/images/krunker/scene/lights_3.png)

```krunkscript
# Add a rectangular light
obj window = GAME.SCENE.addRectLight(
    "#fff",  # str color
    0,       # num x position
    0,       # num y position
    0,       # num z position
    1,       # num width
    1,       # num height
    1        # num intensity (0 - 1)
);
```

## Geometry <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
**Tags: objects, primitives, shapes**
Krunker has a few default objects, like cubes, spheres and planes. These objects allow you to create maps or decorations, and can be managed with KrunkScript.

:::tip
Geometry is client side, and it will thus not have any player collisions
:::

### Krunker object data
:::warning
- You can not change opacity of 3d models in krunker after you have spawned them
- Texture changing does not work on 3d models
- In update 5.4.2 most encodings were removed from krunker. Keep this in mind when using `textureEncoding`
- alwaysRender does not work
:::

### Cube

```krunkscript
# Add a cube to the scene.
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube(
    "28000",    # str texture asset id
    "#fff",     # str color

```

### Plane

```krunkscript
# Add a plane to the scene.
obj plane = GAME.SCENE.addPlane(
    "28000",   # str texture asset id
    "#fff",    # str color

### Sphere
**Tags: ball**
```krunkscript
# Add a sphere to the scene.
obj sphere = GAME.SCENE.addSphere(
    "28000",   # str texture asset id
    "#fff",    # str color
    5,         # num x position

    10,         # num length
    {}          # obj additional data
);
```

### 3D model
**Tags: asset, custom**
:::tip
Currently only .obj and .gltf are supported for 3d models
:::

```krunkscript
# Add an asset to the scene.
GAME.SCENE.addAsset(
    "236t",         # str 3d asset id
    5,              # num x position
    0,              # num y position
    5,              # num z position
    1,              # num scale
    "#fff",         # str color
    {},             # obj additional data
    onObjectLoad    # action() callback when asset loads. (function name is function used for callback)
);
```

### Custom object
Custom objects allow you to create any shape you want using verticies:
:::warning
Textures do not work on addCustom verts
:::

```krunkscript
# Add a 3d model to the scene.
obj custom = GAME.SCENE.addCustom(
    "236t",         # str asset texture id
    "#fff",         # str color
    num[0, 0, 3],   # Float32Array of Vertices
    5,              # num x position
    0,              # num y position
    5,              # num z position
    6,              # num width
    2,              # num height
    10,             # num length
    {}              # obj additional data
);
```

## Locally rotating 3D Objects
:::warning
Rotating objects locally seems to have some weird center offset issue
:::

```krunkscript
# Rotate object locally
object.rotateLocal(
    3,      # x rotation
    0,      # y rotation
    3       # z rotation
);
```

## Listing 3D objects <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
:::tip
GAME.OBJECTS.list() only returns rotation, position, scaling and an id right now
:::

```krunkscript
# Get an obj[] of objects in a scene
GAME.SCENE.list();
```

## Removing 3D objects <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
```krunkscript
# Create a cube reference
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube("", "#fff", 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, {
    opacity: 0.5
});

# Remove cube from the sence by reference
cube.delete();

# Remove all objects from scene
GAME.SCENE.clear();
```

## Attaching/detaching 3D objects <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
You can attach objects to entities or other objects.

```krunkscript
# Create a cube reference
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube("", "#fff", 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, {
    opacity: 0.5
});

# Attach the cube to a camera
cube.attachTo(GAME.CAMERA.getObj(), 0, 0, 0);

# Attach the cube to another object
cube.attachTo(otherObj, 0, 0, 10);

# Attach the cube to a player
cube.attachTo(player, 0, 0, 0);

# Attach the cube to player but from current origin
cube.attachTo(player, 0, 0, 0, true);

# Detach cube
cube.detach();
```

### Attach bones
:::warning
Punctionation such as `.` and `,` get stripped from bone names. This is an issue with Three.js, not with krunker, for more see this [github discussion](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter/issues/295#issuecomment-418138071)
:::

```krunkscript
# Get "HandL" bone from 3D model
leftHand = (obj) dat.getBone("HandL");

# Attach cube to left hand bone
cube.attachTo(leftHand, 0, 0, 0);
```

## Coordinate system
Coordinates in 2D and 3D space are represented as x, y and x, y, z:

```krunkscript
# X: left-right
# Y: up-down
# Z: backward-forward
```

You can convert 3D coordinates into 2D ones:

```krunkscript
# Get screen-space coords
obj coords2D = GAME.SCENE.posToScreen(0, 10, 0);
# Use coords to render to screen
(num) coords2D.x;
(num) coords2D.y;
# You can check if those coordinates or on the screen:
(bool) coords2D.onScreen;
```

## Path nodes <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Path/Coordinate 3D objects that can be added by hand and interacted with using KrunkScript:

```krunkscript
# Fetch list of nodes
obj[] nodes = GAME.OBJECTS.getPathNodes();

for (num i = 0; i < lengthOf nodes; i++) {
    (num) nodes[i].id;
    (num) nodes[i].x;
    (num) nodes[i].y;
    (num) nodes[i].z;
}
```

## Moving, rotating & scaling <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: translation, translating**
```krunkscript
# Create an object reference
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube(
    "",     # str texture id
    "#fff", # str color
    0,      # num x position
    0,      # num y position
    0,      # num z position
    10,     # num width
    10,     # num height
    10      # num length
);

# Set object position
cube.move(0, 0, 0);

# Move object on x-axis
(num) cube.position.x += 1;
cube.position.x = 10;
GAME.SCENE.movObj(cube, 0, 1, 0);

# Scale object
cube.scale.x = 5;
GAME.SCENE.scaleObj(cube, 5, 1, 1);

# Rotate object
cube.rotate(0, 0, Math.PI);
cube.rotation.x = Math.PI;
GAME.SCENE.rotObj(cube, 0, 0, Math.PI);

# Face object towards coordinates.
cube.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
```

## Object visibility <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> 
**Tags: invisible**

You can hide or show krunker objects.

```krunkscript
# Create an object reference
obj cube = GAME.SCENE.addCube("", "#fff", 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10);

# Make object invisible
cube.visible = false;
```

# Scripting

## Hooks <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Hooks are functions called by javascript on the backend, and we overwrite them to include our own functionality.

### start() <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
```krunkscript
# Runs on every game start, thus after every round
public action start() {
    
}
```

### update() <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
```krunkscript

public action update(num delta) {
    # num delta     - time since last update in miliseconds
}
```

### render() <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
:::tip
- Render is called AFTER update
- It's used for the [2d canvas](./rendering_2d.md)
:::

```krunkscript
# Updates every tick, primarily used for updating the 2d canvas.
public action render(num delta) {
    # num delta     - time since last update in miliseconds

### onPlayerUpdate() <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Use this for overriding Krunker's default movement or for creating your own custom movement. Do not use it for updating game objects or making non-client-predicted movement.

```krunkscript
# Runs when player updates, useful for custom movement
public action onPlayerUpdate(str id, num delta, obj inputs) {
    # str id        - player id
    # num delta     - time since last update in miliseconds
    # obj inputs    - input object

```

### onPlayerLeave() <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
:::warning
You can not access the player object after the player has left
:::

```krunkscript
# Runs when a player disconnects from the server

## Default behavior <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Krunkscript allows you to disable default game behaviour.

```krunkscript
GAME.DEFAULT.disablePrediction();       # disable client prediction (client)
GAME.DEFAULT.disablePlayerBehaviour();  # disable player logic (client & server)
GAME.DEFAULT.disable3D();               # disable 3D Scene (client)
GAME.DEFAULT.disableServerSync();       # dont send player data (server)
GAME.INPUTS.disableDefault();           # dont send player inputs (client)
GAME.UI.hideDefault();                  # disables most default UI (client)
GAME.UI.hideCrosshair();                # disables crosshair (client)
GAME.PLAYERS.disableMeshes();           # hide player models (client)

player.defaultMovement = false;         # disables player movement (client & server)
player.defaultVelocity = false;         # disables player velocity (client & server)
player.defaultRotation = false;         # disables player rotations (client & server)
player.disableShooting = true;          # disables shooting & reloading (client & server)
player.disableMelee = true;             # disables melee (client & server)
player.disableDefault("jump");          # disables input behaviours (client & server)
```

## Variables <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Variables are used to store information.

```krunkscript
# Create variable
num number = 1;             # number (int/float)
str text = "hello world";   # text (string)
bool val = true;            # boolean
```

## Naming rules <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
:::warning
- Variables can't start with a number
- Variables can not use special charactes
- Variable names need to be unique
- Functions are also variables, and take up variable names
- Can't call variable names after existing krunker elements like GAME, lengthOf, notEmpty etc.
:::

```krunkscript
# Naming rules
num 0test = 0;      # invalid

num test = 0;       # valid
str _test = "hi";   # valid
num test0 = 0;      # valid
obj name = {};      # valid
```

## Type conversion <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
Converting from one type to another.

```krunkscript
num number = 1;             # create number
str text = (str) number;    # cast to string
str text = toStr number;    # convert number ("Deprecated" according to developers))
num newNum = toNum text;    # convert to string ("Deprecated" according to developers)

num test = toNum "0";       # valid ("Deprecated" according to developers)
num test2 = toNum "a";      # invalid: returns 0 ("Deprecated" according to developers)
```

## Objects <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
**Tags: dictionaries, hashmaps**

:::warning
- Don't forget the ; after creating an object
- hasProp is undocumented, documentation on it might be flawed.
:::

```krunkscript
# Create a basic object
obj car = {
    name: "Toyota",
    x: 0
};

# Change or set properties
(num) car.x += 1;
car.y = 10;

# Checking an empty object
obj other = {};
if (notEmpty other) {
	# this condition would fail
}

# Check if property exists
hasProp car.name;   # returns true
hasProp car.wing;   # returns false
```

## Arrays <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
**Tags: lists, collections, fields, lengthof, size, length, push**

Arrays are used to store several objects/values of the same type.

```krunkscript
# Create array
str[] list = str["a", "b"];
obj[] list = obj[{a: 1}, {a: 5, b: 10}];

# Number array
num[] list = num[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
num test = list[0] + list[1];

# Nested lists
num[][] nested = num[][num[1], num[1, 2]];

# Remove index from array
remove list[0]; # remove first item from list
remove list[i]; # remove specific index from list

# Get array length
lengthOf list;

# Add entry to array
addTo list 10;
```

## Functions & actions <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
KrunkScript allows you to create custom actions (traditionally called functions). For example you could create an action that moves a car and depletes fuel from said car:

:::warning
Krunkscript has no function hoisting. Meaning you have to call a function after it is created.
:::

```krunkscript
# Create basic car object
obj car = {
    x: 0,           # x position
    speed: 0.1,     # cars speed value

### Passing actions as arguments <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 

:::tip
In update v5.4.1 this was announced: "Action parameters are now option for all GAME sub actions". We are not sure what this means, but maybe you do
:::

```krunkscript
# Create function to pass as argument
str action word(str word){
    return "This is a word: " + word;
}

# Pass function as argument
action say(str action(str) funcArg){
    funcArg("Pizza");   # Outputs "This is a word: Pizza"
}
```

## Debugging <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
**Tags: Log, Println, Say**
Use the following functions to help you when debugging

```krunkscript
GAME.log("Text");                           # logs text to the browser console
GAME.log(object);                           # logs object to console
GAME.log((str) number + "text");            # combine number with text

# You can cleanly chain variables together in a log like this:

GAME.log("test", "test2", 6, [0, 1, 2]);    # returns: test test2 6 [0, 1, 2]
```

## String manipulation & testing <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 
You can use KrunkScript to manipulate strings in several ways.

:::tip
Regex support has been confirmed by the developers, but it not yet available
:::

:::details Developer statement regarding UTILS.truncateTxt's random dots.
‟I think its for aesthetic purposes when text overflows, but could also be a bug„ ~ KPal, discord
:::

```krunkscript
# Create string
str testString = "Test";    

str string2 = testString + "Me";                            # Combine strings
str string3 = UTILS.toUpper(testString);                    # Makes text uppercase (returns "TEST")
str string4 = UTILS.toLower(testString);                    # Makes text lowercase (returns "test")

UTILS.truncateTxt(
    "test",  #str input
    4,       #num point to start truncating from
    true,    #bool hide dots after string (?)
    1        #num index to start truncating backwards from
);

str string5 = UTILS.truncateTxt("123456", 2, true);         # Reduce text to first 2 characters (returns "12")
str string6 = UTILS.truncateTxt("123456", 2, false);        # results in: "12..."
str string7 = UTILS.replaceText("hello there", "the", "");  # results in: "hello re"
```

```krunkscript
# Create string
str testString = "test"; 
if (UTILS.textContains(testString, "test")) {
	# Check if string contains certain value
}
```

You can also check certain properties of a string:

```krunkscript
# Create string
str testString = "test"; 
if (UTILS.textContains(testString, "test")) {
	# Check if string contains certain value
}
```

### Saving string to keyboard <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

```krunkscript
# Copies text to clipboard
UTILS.copyToClipboard("hello world");
```

## Loops <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 

```krunkscript
# Create for loop
for (num i = 0; i < 10; i++) { # loop 10 times
	# more code here
}
```

```krunkscript
# Create while loop
num test = 10;
while (test > 0) { # loop 10 times
	test--;
}
```

```krunkscript
# Create object property loop
obj test = {x: 1, y: 4, z: 2};
for (obj prop in test) {
    GAME.log(number.key, number.value);  # x 1, y 4, z 2
}
```

```krunkscript
# Iterate over array
str[] list = str["a", "b", "c"];
for (num i = 0; i < lengthOf list; i++) {
    GAME.log(list[i]); # log item in list
}
```

```krunkscript
# You can break out of a loop (end loop entirely):
for (num i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
		break; # ends loop
	}
}
```

```krunkscript
# You can also continue out of a loop (jump to next iteration):
for (num i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        continue; # go to next iteration
    }
    GAME.log("Test " + toStr i);
}
```

## Conditions & if statements <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" /> 

If statements allow you to run certain code only if a certain condition is met.

```krunkscript
num value = 10;
if (value > 20) {
    GAME.log("Bigger than 20");
} 
else {
    GAME.log("Less than or equal to 20");
}
```

```krunkscript
# Condition operators

value > other   # greater than
value >= other  # greater than or the same
value < other   # less than
value <= other  # less than or the same
value == other  # same as
value != other  # not the same as

condition && condition  # multiple conditions must be met
condition || condition  # any condition is met

# You can also check if a value exists/is true
if (!!value) {

}

# Some examples
if ((10 < 5) || (5 == 10)) {
    # wont run
}

str test = "ab";
if (("a"+"b") == test && (1+1) == 2) {
    # will run
}

# Ternary operations
num = (true ? 1 : 0);
```

## Voxel <Badge type="tip" text="???" vertical="middle" />
Krunker offers two methods for a future voxel gamemode, speculated to be a survival minecraft style game.

```krunkscript
# Destroy voxel
GAME.VOXEL.destroy(
    4,      # num voxel id
);
```

```krunkscript
# Place voxel
GAME.VOXEL.place(
    4,          # num x position
    4,          # num y position
    4,          # num z position
    ???,        # ??? type of block
    {}          # obj additional data
);
```

## NFT <Badge type="tip" text="???" vertical="middle" />

:::details Developer statement on NFT methods
‟Added Basic NFT functions: hasWallet, ownedAssets (check docs)„ ~ Krunker development team, patchnotes.
It was never added to the docs.
:::

```krunkscript
obj player = GAME.PLAYERS.getSelf();

# Check if player owns certain assets
GAME.NFT.ownedAssets(
    player.id,      #str player id
    ???             #??? collection
    callback        #action(???) callback
);

# Check if player  has a crypto wallet
GAME.NFT.hasWallet(
    player.id       #str player id
);
```

## Config <Badge type="tip" text="???" vertical="middle" />

```krunkscript
GAME.CONFIG.getClasses();           # Get objects with class information
GAME.CONFIG.getMatch();             # Get objects with match information
GAME.CONFIG.getSettings();          # Get objects with settings information
GAME.CONFIG.getWeapons();           # Get objects with weapon information
```

## Delay <Badge type="tip" text="???" vertical="middle" />

:::warning
This feature was removed from autocomplete
:::

```krunkscript
# Delay a script execution
GAME.UTILS.delay(
    afterDelay        # action(???) callback when delay has passed
    200               # num time in miliseconds
);
```

## Raycast <Badge type="tip" text="???" vertical="middle" />

:::details Developer statement on Raycast methods
‟Added raycast support (WIP - check docs)„ ~ Krunker development team, patchnotes.
It was never added to the docs.
:::

```krunkscript
# Raycast from point in space (returns void)
GAME.RAYCAST.from(
    0,                # num x position
    0,                # num y position
    0,                # num z position
    5,                # num radian x direction
    5,                # num radian y direction
    200               # num distance of ray
);
```

```krunkscript
# Get player object
obj player = GAME.PLAYERS.getSelf();

# Raycast from player (returns void)
GAME.RAYCAST.fromPlayer(
    player,           # obj player reference
    200               # num distance
);
```

## Player LOD <Badge type="tip" text="???" vertical="middle" />
A dead feature to change LOD of players, likely created for 7fi's & Ocotodools spacesim project.

```krunkscript
GAME.PLAYERS.toggleLOD(
    1       #num value
);
```

## Execute trigger <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />

```krunkscript
GAME.TRIGGERS.execute(num ID, ??? args){
    #???
}
```

## Object morphing <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: Morph targets, Shape keys**

You can interpolate between morphstates on a 3d model. Does not work.
```krunkscript
    object.updateMorph(
        "Comedy",       # str morph target/Shape key
        0.2             # num value (0 - 1)
    );
```

## Fixed delta <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
:::tip
You can get fixed delta regularly by deviding the last GAME.TIME.now() by the current one.
:::

Suposed to give delta non dependent on game speed on the client side. Currently gives regular delta. Server side is not affected by game speed.
```krunkscript
GAME.TIME.fixedDelta();
```

## Payment <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
Suposed to allow scripters to give and charge players for KR. Unimplemented.

```krunkscript
    GAME.PAYMENTS.charge(
        # ???
    );

    GAME.PAYMENTS.giveKR(
        player.id,          # str player id
        5                   # num kr value to give
    );
```

## Libraries <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" /> <Badge type="tip" text="server-side" vertical="middle" />
Allows for importing external tooling for krunkscript. Not enough is known about the implementation of this yet.


# User interface

## Adding an element/div <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />

You can add your own UI elements to krunker using KrunkScript. If needed, you can [disable the default krunker UI](/unmerged/scripting.html#default-behavior).

```krunkscript
# Create a div (and get its str id)
# Specifying the parent div will make the div a child of that parent
str id = GAME.UI.addDIV(
    "minimap",                       # str id of div
    true,                            # bool is shown (display: none)
    "width: 10px; height: 10px",     # str CSS styling as string
	"gameUI"                         # str parent div id (default: "customGUIHolder")
);
```

### Changing div properties
```krunkscript
# Update div style property
GAME.UI.updateDIV(
    "minimap",              # str id of div
    "background-color",     # str property
    "red"                   # str value
);
```

### Getting div properties
```krunkscript
# Get property of div, returns str css value
    GAME.UI.getProp(
        "minimap"           # str id of div
        "background-color"  # property to get value of
    );
```

### Changing div text
```krunkscript
# Update div text
GAME.UI.updateDIVText(
    "minimap",      # str id of div
    "hello world"   # str text
);
```

### Get div text
```krunkscript
# Get div text
GAME.UI.getDIVText(
    "book"      # str id of div
);
```

### Moving the div
**Tags: clone**
```krunkscript
# Create element
GAME.UI.addDIV("sott_test", true, "");

# Move element to a different parent
GAME.UI.moveDIV(
    "sott_test",            # Current child id
    "gameUI",               # New parent to move to
    "sott_test_2"           # New child id
);
```

### Removing the div
```krunkscript
# Remove the div
GAME.UI.removeDIV(
    "minimap"       #str id of div
);
```

### Onclick  event listener
```krunkscript
# Runs when div is clicked
public action onDIVClicked(str id) {
    if (id == "minimap") {
        # do something
    };
}
```

### Changing document title
```krunkscript
# Set document title to string
GAME.setTitle(
    "My krunker map"    #str document name
);
```

## Image element <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
**Tags: img**
```krunkscript
# Add image element
str id = GAME.UI.addImage(
    "39190",                        # str image asset id
    "image",                        # str element id
    true,                           # bool is shown (display: none)
    "width: 10px; height: 10px"     # str CSS styling as string
    "gameUI"                        # str parent div id (default: "customGUIHolder")
);
```

## Custom CSS & phone compatability <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
Using pure css, you can create phone compatable UI's. For more on mods check out [Mod/Resource packs](/unmerged/mod-resource_packs.html)

You can detect and adjust UI to phones using some of the following code:

```css
/* Hide by div id on mobile*/
#uiBase .isMobile #div_id {
    display: none;
}

/* Hide div based on screensize */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    #div_id {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

### Mobile specific elements <Badge type="tip" text="client-side" vertical="middle" />
Some elements are specific to mobile and can be edited and repositioned with CSS. Here is a list of the Mobile specific elements available by default:

```css
#mobileJoystick{}     /*Joystick to move with*/
#mobileJump{}         /*Jump button*/
#mobileCrouch{}       /*Crouch button*/
#mobileEsc{}          /*Return to menu button*/
#mobileShoot{}        /*Shoot button*/
#mobileAimShoot{}     /*Button to aim & shoot at the same time*/
#mobileScope{}        /*Aim down sight button*/
#mobileReload{}       /*Reload button*/
#mobileSwap{}         /*Button to swap between primary and secondary*/
#mobileKSwap{}        /*Button to swap between knife and primary*/
```
